}
</style>


-   A webapp for creating, editing, and viewing course schedules
-   A work in progress -- but useful in its current state
-   A CS Senior project
    -   Minimal support is available, and on student/faculty schedules.

## Issues

-   Currently **1st-half and 2nd-half courses are flagged as a conflict** if they use the same room/instructor/etc.

-   This has been **tested on a few departments**, but

    -   likely we have not encountered every quirky case that happens somewhere on campus.

-   **Use the Notes field** to communicate to your dean and Student Success if you can't get Course Schedulizer to do exactly what you want.

-   **Bugs?** Email randall.pruim\@calvin.edu and/or keith.vanderlinden\@calvin.edu

## Coming eventually

-   Constraint checking

    -   Don't schedule these courses at the same time!

-   Comparing two schedules

    -   How is this year different from last?
    -   How is what I submitted different from what was entered into Workday?

-   **Feature requests?** Email randall.pruim\@calvin.edu and/or keith.vanderlinden\@calvin.edu
